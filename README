CPU USAGE TRACKER
================================================================================================
This is a simple console application for tracking CPU usage. It consists of multiple threads
working together to read CPU informations, calcpulate CPU usage, print the average CPU usage,
and ensure program responsiveness. It includes a logger thread to save messages to "log.txt".

(1) Reader thread reads the /proc/stat file and send the extracted CPU usage data to the 
    analyzer thread.

(2) Analyzer thread processes the received data and calculates the CPU usage for each CPU core.
    It sends the processed data (CPU usage for each core) to the Printer thread.

(3) Printer thread prints the average CPU usage (expressed in percentage) on the screen, once 
    per second.

(4) Watchdog thread monitors the activity of other threads. If no information is received for 
    2 seconds, it terminates the program with an appropriate error message.

(5) Logger thread accepts messages from all threads and saves them to a file. The logger is used 
    to write synchronized debug prints to the file.
